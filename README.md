# REST: REwriting in SmT solvers

## Using Liquid Haskell Tactics

The code for the template Haskell proof generator is available [here](https://github.com/mustafahafidi/qc-to-lh)

The Liquid Haskell fork that supports rewriting is available [here](https://github.com/zgrannan/liquidhaskell/tree/rw-termination-noplugin2)
